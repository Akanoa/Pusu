/// The `Server` struct represents a test server setup for the application.
///
/// It is designed to initialize and manage the test server, including the creation
/// of an in-memory database guard and a Biscuit keypair. The server facilitates communication
/// with clients for testing purposes.
///
/// ## Fields
/// - `_guard`: A `DatabaseGuardOnce` instance that ensures the database is properly initialized
///   and maintained during the lifetime of the server.
/// - `keypair`: A Biscuit keypair used for authentication purposes. The public key is shared
///   with services interacting with the server.
/// - `server`: A handle to the test server that allows connection and communication.
///
/// ## Methods
/// - `new`: Asynchronously creates a new server instance, initializing the database, Biscuit
///   keypair, and starting the test server.
/// - `get_biscuit`: Generates a Biscuit token for a specified tenant, using the server's keypair.
/// - `get_connection`: Establishes a connection to the server and returns the connected `TcpStream`.
/// - `get_client`: Asynchronously retrieves a client instance that can be used for requests,
///   validating the serverâ€™s initial response.

    /// - A test server that simulates the application server, configured with the initialized
    ///   storage backend and public key for authentication.
