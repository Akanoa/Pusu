## Overview

**Project Name** is a Rust-based application that leverages powerful libraries such as `tokio`, `foundationdb`, `actix`,
and more. It is designed to handle asynchronous operations, database interactions, and provides support for secure
authentication and structured error handling.

## Features

- **Asynchronous IO**: Powered by `tokio` for high-performance, non-blocking operations.
- **Database Support**: Integrates with FoundationDB for reliable transactional storage.
- **Authentication**: Secure token management via `biscuit-auth`.
- **Error Handling**: Uses `thiserror` for ergonomic error management.
- **Command-line Interface**: Built using `clap` for customizable and extensible CLI options.
- **Tracing and Logging**: Provides instrumentation for tracking application state using `tracing` and
  `tracing-subscriber`.

## Requirements

- **Rust**: Ensure you have Rust 1.85.1 (or later) installed.
- **Dependencies**: This project relies on the following key dependencies:
    - `prost` for protocol buffer support.
    - `tokio` for async runtime.
    - `clap` for CLI management.
    - `foundationdb` and `foundationdb-tuple` for database operations.
    - `tracing` for structured logging and application tracing.

For a complete list of dependencies, refer to `Cargo.toml`.
